# Data Logger for HEPA filter testing
This repository contains firmware, test code, and instructions associated with the data logger used for HEPA filter testing and general air quality monitoring. 

The [wiki](https://github.com/airpartners/logger/wiki) contains a comprehensive guide to provisioning, deploying, and running the sensor box, the [test](https://github.com/airpartners/logger/tree/master/test) folder contains test code, and the repo's [top-level directory](https://github.com/airpartners/logger) includes firmware and scripts needed to run the box in production.

As of Fall 2020, we've been using the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/airpartners/logger/issues) to track bugs and tasks and the [Hardware Overview](https://github.com/airpartners/logger/wiki/hardware-overview) section of the wiki to track the current state of hardware the team is working on.

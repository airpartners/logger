# Test
This folder contains test code associated with the development features for and
debugging of the components of the sensor box. 

The scripts assume that the raspberry pi has environment variables set for the
switching period, valve serial port, and MCPC serial port. To set those values,
run the following command:
```
source setup_debug.sh
```
For additional information, check out the development page in the wiki.

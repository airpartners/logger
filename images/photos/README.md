# Photos
This directory contains photos associated with the sensor box documentation.
Note that these photos need not be referenced directly in the wiki; if there's
a photo or diagram that could be useful to hang on to, it can go here for others
to quickly access and reference. If you want to update the component photos,
there is a [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IrVTFMlNiK_rmQ--ESAgUP8sEPo5v4seMoUniz0XqTc/edit?usp=sharing)
with old labeled diagrams you can reuse pieces of. Anyone with access to the air
partners gogle drive should be abel to access that page.

Feel free to delete this entire directory locally from a provisioned raspberry
pi (or the entire [images/](https://github.com/airpartners/logger/tree/master/images)
directory while you are at it) if you are short on memory, but please make sure
we keep up-to-date photos and diagrams in an accessible place.
